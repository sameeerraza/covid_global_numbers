# covid_global_numbers

This project aims to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. The project includes visualizations and analysis of the COVID-19 dataset, which shows the number of cases, deaths, and death percentages by country and continent.

The project starts with a global summary, which provides an overview of the total number of cases, deaths, and death percentages. A bar chart is included to visualize the total number of deaths by continent, providing a regional perspective on the impact of COVID-19.

The map visualization shows the density of COVID-19 cases by country, allowing users to see which countries have been the most affected by the pandemic. The line graph provides a trend analysis of the percent population infected and predicts what may happen in the future.

This project is intended to help individuals and organizations understand the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale. It provides a clear visualization of the data and allows users to interact with the data to gain insights.

The project was created using Tableau and SQL, and the code is available in this repository. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own data analysis projects.
